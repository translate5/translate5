# Open Source Translation System
## Cloud translation, review, post-editing and terminology platform
 The mission of translate5 is the community-driven and continuous development of the open source and cloud-based translation management system of the language industry.
 
 Translate5 is developed by the collaboration of professionals. We come together as translation experts, language researchers and translation software developers who are aware of the special needs of a translation tool. Communicating and discussing the expectations with each other let to the realisation of their special needs and become true as cloud-based TMS. This process is led and organised by MittagQI as the lead development company doing large parts of the development work behind translate5. MittagQI coordinates the road-map with the community and ensures good architecture and a high code quality.
