            - several smaller fixes and content changes

2014-03-21: new features:
            - alternates: All columns with a column header of CSV files are imported now, and displayed as editable columns
            - a horizontal navigation between the editable columns is available if there are more than one target
            - Comments of a segment are relocated into the metapanel on the right

2013-11-22: By default export does not export termTags in the target any more 
            (but still in the source). Reason is, that Trados Studio sometimes
            seem to destroy segments when termTags and change-history are contained.
            The export of termTags in the target can be activated again by application.ini
2013-10-29: changes in translation process. See ZfExtended/docs/changes.txt
2013-10-07: new features:
        - Integration of taskoverview and useradministration
            - A head row is added to translate5 with the following informations:
            - Branding of the client (translate5 or DFKI)
            - Name of the current task 
            - Buttons to:
            → close the current editing session (→ logout)
            → return to administration (ends also the current editing session)
            → finish task (finishes the task and returns 
                to the administration)
            → end task (ends the task and returns to the administration; only with
                project management rights)

            Opening the administration pages means closing the current opened 
            editor panels. In the west panel of translate5 admin-pages the user 
            is able to switch between user and task administration.

            The user or task administration is opened in the main part of 
            the viewport.

        - User management, rights and roles



2013-09-16: linebreaks and other whitespace inside sdlxliff-segments is now
	protected in form of internal tags inside translate5 and is restored
	on export.
	For linuxBreaks (\n) the tag <softReturn/> is inserted.
	For windowsBreaks (\r\n) the tag <hardReturn/> is inserted.
	For macBreaks (\r) the tag <macReturn/> is inserted.
	For muliple normal spaces in a row the first space remains untouched 
	and the others are replaced with a single tag <space/>.
	For all other whitespace each char is replace with a <space/>-tag on its own.
	The following chars are protected as "all other whitespace":
		U+0009 	HT, Horizontal Tab
		U+000B 	VT, Vertical Tab
		U+000C 	FF, Form feed
		U+0085 	NEL, Next line
		U+00A0 	no-break space

		U+205F 	medium mathematical space 	 	
		U+3000 	ideographic space 	
		
2013-09-16: The recreation of termTags (called on the serverside after 
saving of a segment) so far also did tag strings inside of tags (i. e. inside 
the title-attribute of a "<a>"-tag. This is fixed now.
		
2013-08-16: csv-import and export added. column-headers for csv-import are defined in application.ini of the editor-module.
            Default is: firstline: mid, secondline: source, third line: target
            Default can be overridden by iniOverwrites/../editorApplication.ini
