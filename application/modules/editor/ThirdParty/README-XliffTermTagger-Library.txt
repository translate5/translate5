Translate5 needs the XliffTermTagger Library from Klemens Waldh√∂r.
Currently the XliffTermTagger is not public available. 

To get XliffTermTagger contact us: support@mittagqi.com

It is planned to release the XliffTermTagger as Open Source. 
If this is done, we will include XliffTermTagger in this version of
translate5.

The lib has to be stored in the directory "XliffTermTagger".
