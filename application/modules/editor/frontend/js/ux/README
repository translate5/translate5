Purpose of this directory: 
provide a unified way to include extjs ux libraries at one place, which is used with setPath in ExtJS then.

Usage: 
Embed the UX extensions via composer.
Symlink the libraries / files and their licenses here, then set their path in app-js-development.phtml (see example there)

The extjs delivered UX directory content is configured as separate Path.

Deployment:
The translate5 deploy process bundles this directory then as zip, downloaded separatly by the translate5 installer. 
The licenses are handled by the comcast/php-legal-licenses, though each license should be provided here as symlink too!
