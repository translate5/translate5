<h1>What is Lorem <b>Ipsum</b>?</h1>

<p>Lorem <b>Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>

<p>Lorem <b>Ipsum</b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>

<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p> 

<p>Lorem <b>Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>

<p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <b>Ipsum</b> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem <b>Ipsum</b>.</p>

<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</p>
 
<p>The point of using Lorem <b>Ipsum</b> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>

<p>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem <b>Ipsum</b> as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem <b>Ipsum</b>' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
