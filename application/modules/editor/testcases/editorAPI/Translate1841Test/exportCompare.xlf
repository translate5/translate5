translate5 autostates show the segment state more in detail, than xliff 2 is able to. To reflect the Autostates the substate attribute of xliff 2 is used. Autostates are mapped to xliff 2 segment state as best as possible

Mapping of translate5 autostates to xliff 2.x substate to xliff 2.x default segment state is as follows.

Please note:
- "auto-set" are status flags, that are set by the "translate5 repetition editor" (auto-propagate)
- "untouched, auto-set" are status flags, that are changed automatically when a user finishes its job, because the finish means approval of everything, he did not touch manually.

<!-- The translate5:translated attribut on mrk-tags of type="term" shows, if the marked term has been found as translated in the corresponding target segment or not.
 The allowed values are "found", "notfound" and "undefined". Undefined usually means, that no term has been defined in the target language of the terminology.
 The translate5:translated attribute can only occur inside of the source-tag.
	
 The translate5:status  attribut on mrk-tags of type="term" shows the term classification of the term in the terminology.
 Its values can be one of the following: preferredTerm, admittedTerm, legalTerm, regulatedTerm, standardizedTerm, deprecatedTerm, supersededTerm.
 translate5:status can occur in mrk tags inside of source AND target tags.
 translate5:termid contains the term id used for that term in translate5.

<!--
If there is a QM flag on the entire segment in translate5, an mrk-tag surrounding the entire segment content with the attribute its:locQualityIssuesRef is used.
The value of the its:locQualityIssuesRef attribute contains the translate5-specific ids of all qm flags, that are added to the entire segment.
The ids are separated by underscore (this means the id e. g. looks like "1_3_5", if three QM flags have been selected for the segment and they have the ids 1, 3 and 5 in translate5).
The actual values of the qm-flags are listed in the its:locQualityIssues tag above.
-->
	
<!--
mrk-tags with the translate5:trackChanges attribute show, where changes have been made inside of the segment.
translate5:trackChanges="ins" reflect inserted strings and translate5:trackChanges="del" show deleted strings.
The other attributes of these mrk tags are self-explaining. The value of the id is random, since inside of translate5 there is no id for these tags.
The value of translate5:date is in the format  "2017-12-06 13:12:34"
