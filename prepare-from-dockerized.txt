; Applicable for Windows only
:
; When translate5-instance is set up via docker-compose on Windows, the huge performance problem
; revealed due to that application root directory (e.g. the directory where this file is localed)
; is mapped as a bind-volume to '/var/www/translate5'-directory within a php-container filesystem. 
; 
; This is a Windows-specific problem, related to how WSL works with huge quantity of mapped files
; and especially the quantity of php-files that are autoloaded during application bootstrap. Mostly
; this is because of there are ~8.5k php-files total in 'vendor/' -directory, and this leads to that
; application loading time is more than 5 minutes on Core i7 32GB RAM host machine

; You should do the following steps in order to adopt translate5-instance installed via docker-compose
; for running using local apache and php rather than apache and php existing inside php-container

; Important: run "symlinks.bat" after main translate5-repo is cloned but before docker-compose based installation is started

1.Stop the php-container within then docker-compose project you already have up and running
2.Create file 'windows-installer-config.ini' having 'INSTALL_PHP_PATH=C:\your\path\to\php.exe' and 'INSTALL_MYSQL_PATH=C:\your\path\to\mysql.exe'
3.Run command: "translate5.bat config runtimeOptions.plugins.VisualReview.visualConverterUrl http://visualconverter.:8087"
4.Run command: "translate5.bat config runtimeOptions.worker.server http://php:80"
5.Run command: "echo 127.0.0.1 translate5.local php db termtagger frontendmessagebus languagetool okapi pdfconverter visualconverter t5memory >> C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
6.Run SQL query: "DELETE FROM `Zf_memcache` WHERE `id` IN ('helper_paths_editor', 'helper_paths_default');" as paths are prefixed with '/var/www/' there
7.Start local apache (having PHP version 8.x)
