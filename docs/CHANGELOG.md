## [5.0.11] - 2020-10-14

### Important Notes:
#### [TRANSLATE-2045](https://jira.translate5.net/browse/TRANSLATE-2045)
- This update modifies the whole data of the database! 
Therefore a back up of the database directly before the update is mandatory!
- On larger installations this update may need some time (for example for 2.5 million segments in 700 tasks the script needed about 15 minutes)
- The database script requires user with ALTER privilege on the database - which should be the case if installed translate5 as described in the installation guide.
- In the case of errors collect them and send them to us and restore your backup. 
- In the issue description is a manual guide for the migration
