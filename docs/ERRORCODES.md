# EventCodes

## TODO STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT
Work in progress of implementing the errorcodes as MD file!

## List of Error- and EventCodes
In the future each error or event in translate5 should have an own event code to improve support / make live for help desk easier.

Formerly this list was maintained in:

Found content: {content} | Translate5 interprets the XLIFF 1.2 specification in a way that in a segmented segment there may not be any other content as whitespace outside between the &lt;mrk type=&quot;seg&quot;&gt; tags. If this is the case translate5 can not import the XLF file.

## EventCode Design rules / decisions
- Prefixed with &quot;E&quot; so that a search for the error code through the code is more reliable than just searching for a number
- No structure in the numbering to prevent discussions is it an error E12XX or E45XX
- Do not start at 1 and don't use leading zeros.
- Each usage of an error in the code should get separate code. Even if the error message / reason is the same. Reason is that the help desk might need to do different things in different cases.
- Information about the error here in the list should not be copied, but errors can point to another errors: &quot;E 4321: See E 1234&quot;. Thats work to maintain, but better as confusing the client by giving wrong hints.
- if it makes sense for the support / help desk to split up an error in different errorcodes because of different reasons, than this should be done in the code so far

## to get highest ecode:
- call <code>t5 dev:ecode</code> to get it globally
- from the current document use: <code>php -r '$text = file_get_contents("ERRORCODES.md"); preg_match_all("/(E[0-9]{4})/", $text, $codes); print_r(max(array_unique($codes[0])));echo "\n";'</code>
- or to get a whole list sorted from lowest to highest <code>php -r '$text = file_get_contents("ERRORCODES.md"); preg_match_all("/(E[0-9]{4})/", $text, $codes); $codes = array_unique($codes[0]); sort($codes); print_r($codes);echo "\n";'</code>
